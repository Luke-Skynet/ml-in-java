# MLDS-in-Java

This is my learning project/library where I implement regression, classification, and other things from scratch in Java.

## modules
* **linreg** - Multiple Linear Regression capability using gradient descent.    
* **logreg** - Multiple Logistic Regression capability also using gradient descent.    
* **math** - Matrices and Vectors using float arrays (for speed). Also includes common functions activation functions in Neural nets. 
* **nn** - Work in progress! I am still working on translating the backprop algo found in many DL textbooks to matrix notation so I can code it.   
* **test** - These are some cool scripts that demo the functionality of all the modules. My favorite is LinRegTest since it's really fast!
