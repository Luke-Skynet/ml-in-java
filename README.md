# MLDS-in-Java

This is my learning project/library where I implement regression, classification, and other things from scratch in Java.

## modules
* **linreg** - Multiple Linear Regression capability using gradient descent.    
* **logreg** - Multiple Logistic Regression capability also using gradient descent.    
* **math** - Matrix and Vector classes with various operations used by the regression modules.
* **nn** - Neural Network classifier using Softmax / Cross Entropy loss with Adam optimization.
* **test** - These are some cool scripts that demo the functionality of all the modules.
