# MLDS-in-Java
This is my learning project where I implement core ML/statistics techniques from scratch in Java

## modules
**linreg** - Multiple Linear Regression capability using gradient descent   
**logreg** - Multiple Logistic Regression capability, also using gradient descent   
**math** - Matrices and Vectors using float arrays, so it is super fast. Also common functions activation functions in Neural nets  
**nn** - Work in progress! I am still working on translating the backprop algo found in DL textbooks to matrix notation so I can code it    
**test** - these are some cool scripts that demo the functionality of all the modules. My favorite is linregtest bc it's really fast!
